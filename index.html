            Hi my name is David, I am 23 years old and I live in Sacramento, California. I have lived in Sac since I moved here from Mexico when I was about 6 years old. I am currently in school studting computer engineering. I decided to study computer engineering because I have always been curious since I was little on how it was that computers/video games worked. After changing my major twice in college I finally found something that I am really interested in.
            </p>
            <p>
            I currently work as a cook in an Italian restaurant. Cooking has been one of my favorite hobbies since I was little. Not only because I like the challenges of working a kitchen but also because I love food. Some of the other things that I love to do on my free time is reading, playing music, working out, and spending time with my family.
